# `screencaps` Mac command line timed screen capture

See `man screencapture` for details on how this works.  

`screencapture <-switches> <file path and name>`

Some notable switches are:

* `-m` only capture the main screen
* `-c` to clipboard
* `-T #` delay # seconds before taking screen capture
* `-x` silent


In this project, I make a simple loop to save a series of timed screen shots
